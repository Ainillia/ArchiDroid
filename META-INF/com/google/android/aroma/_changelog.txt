ArchiDroid 2.2

- [!] ArchiDroid is now built from source, thus it's independent fork of CM now
# ArchiDroid is based on @Cristiano Matos (crDroid) sources, but it's self-compiled by me
# From technical point of view this is a big change, but from your point of view it still has nearly all functions provided by temasek, f.e. HALO, Navigation bar, and more
# Slowly *maybe* AD will have even more unique features, as for now consider it as independent crDroid-fork
