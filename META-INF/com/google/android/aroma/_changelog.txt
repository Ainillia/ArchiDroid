ArchiDroid 2.1.4
- Archi's Audiophile Preset changes
* DAC Direct is now disabled to ensure compatibility with Spirit FM (this fixes no sound in Spirit FM)
* Equalizer Update. Raised band 5 from 3 -> 6. 8 4 4 2 3 -> 8 4 4 2 6
# Please note that these updates won't be pushed with ArchiDroid Update mode, as presets are only updated during ArchiDroid Install mode.
# Nobody would like to see his own preset being overwritten by ArchiDroid during update, alright? ;)

- ArchiDroid doesn't delete /data/.temasek during flashing now
# Your own preset is preserved as long as you stick with the right choice in aroma's custom preset, this means selecting "no config".

- ArchiDroid Scripts BIG update and improvements
* ArchiDroid_FstrimData - From Android 4.3 I'm happy to include fstrim "on demand" to ArchiDroid. By executing this script you call fstrim() on /data partition. If you want to learn more google "TRIM".
* ArchiDroid_FstrimAll - Same as above but also calls fstrim() on /cache /preload /system /efs in addition to /data. This is NOT recommended by me, as these partitions are RARELY being used in terms of writing but sometimes it may be useful to fstrim them as well.
# Please note that you SHOULD NOT fstrim too often. I'd say once per month is more than enough. I'd also advise to avoid other fstrim apps/scripts such as "LagFix", as my scripts do the same "on demand" and in natively way implemented directly in kernel.

* ArchiDroid_RestoreEFS - Restores /efs from backup made during flashing of ArchiDroid and reboots the system. Many people wanted to have such feature so here it is.
* ArchiDroid_RemoveArchiDroid - Removes ArchiDroid folder completely and reboots into recovery, allowing you to flash other ROM without any junk left by ArchiDroid. Please don't use this script during updates and cleaning, as ArchiDroid needs this folder.
