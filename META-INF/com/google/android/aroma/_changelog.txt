* ArchiDroid Commons
- [!] Implemented ArchiDroid Partition Wizard and full F2FS support for /system /preload /cache(*) /data(*)
# Option for reformatting to F2FS is only available if your custom recovery and chosen kernel support it
# Reformatting is optional, by default ArchiDroid won't perform any action
# (*) /cache is not being able to reformat back to ext4 from ArchiDroid Partition Wizard, while you can't reformat /data at all if you're flashing from internal sd card. This is on my todo

- [!] Reworked recovery flashing
# Now you can flash recovery TRULY before ArchiDroid flashing
# If you choose recovery flashing option, ArchiDroid won't be flashed at all, instead, it will flash your recovery and then reboot it (recovery)
# If any recovery update will be needed in the future, this way you won't need to do it manually anymore (as long as proper recovery is available in ArchiDroid)

- Added Devil's Recovery
# This is the only recovery with F2FS support for now, you can use above reworked method to flash it right from ArchiDroid itself

- ADBLOCK: Added FORCE_LOCAL_DNSES, which may be useful in case of wrong answers from global DNSes but good from local ones, which are slower than global ones. Disabled by default
- Fixed AdBlock not working on some kernels
- Updated Devil Kernel to 2.4.8e
- Updated SuperSU to 1.93
