ArchiDroid 2.1
Full Wipe recommended, NOT required

- [!] ArchiDroid is now based on Temasek's Unofficial CM10.2 Build (once again) due to fixed /data/app bug
- [!] CrossBreeder's AdBlock doesn't work correctly with Android 4.3 yet. Temporary it's disabled and replaced with standard AdAway hosts file
- Added/Converted inverted Google Hangouts to Google Apps (from old Google Core), disabled in default preset
- Fixed a bug introduced in 2.0.3 which caused reset of stweaks preset after reboot. Also presets are now even more universal and touch only things which need to be changed instead of all values
- Added new STweaks preset "ArchiDroid Ultra Battery Preset", it is based on Archi's Ultra Battery V2 with LCDFreq zzmoove profile and literally gives you MAXIMUM of battery life for a cost of performance. Use with caution, laggs will appear.
- Updated Temasek Kernel to 110813
- Updated Google Store to 4.3.10 (Multi-DPI patched, inverted)
- Updated Nova to 2.2
