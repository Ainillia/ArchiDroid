ArchiDroid 2.2.5

<tempchangelog>
- SCREW CHANGELOG, WE HAVE KITKAT
- It SEEMS stable enough to put it in experimental, however take care anyway

- WARNING! YOU NEED REQUIRED RECOVERY TO FLASH THIS EXPERIMENTAL
!! Flash required_recovery.zip and then restart your recovery, this is MANDATORY (or you'll get set_perm errors). PhilZ doesn't work yet, sorry

!! WARNING, ARCHIDROID IS NOT YET MERGED SUCCESSFULLY, NO TESTS APART FROM BAREBONES PRESET WERE MADE
!! In other words choose barebones preset or you're on your own. Don't expect anything from first experimentals.

- KNOWN BUGS / ISSUES:
a) Recovery is not working properly right now. Some block-related things are broken, it includes format of /data and also ArchiDroid_Detect and wipe.sh (ArchiDroid Install Mode)
Workaround: If you need full wipe format /data in previous recovery or manualy delete everything APART FROM /data/media from /data folder

b) Google Apps are not updated yet

c) External SD Cards don't work, at least exFAT-formatted ones
</tempchangelog>

# (yo dawg I heard you like tweaking, so I'm tweaking your tweaker so it could tweak while I tweak it)
# It includes enabled AdBlock (yes, don't use AdAway, it slows your device with such big hosts file) and disabled non-universal tweaks, like readahead (no more forced 4096)
