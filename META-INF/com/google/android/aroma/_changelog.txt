- Changed ArchiDroid-specific /dev/archidroid implementation to more flexible tmpfs mounted under /system/archidroid/tmpfs, this is to make i9305, i9000, YP-G1 and all future ports happier
# Fellow ArchiDroid-ports users, this should fix ARCHIDROID_CRON for you - Tethering and Adblock

- [!] Implemented ArchiDroid Hardswap
# ArchiDroid Hardswap allows you to trade your flash memory speed and lifetime for more memory. This option will create special swap file on your desired location and let Android use it for extra memory
# Every chunk of extra memory results in small decrease in I/O speed. Please note that using hardswap may significantly decrease your flash memory lifetime
