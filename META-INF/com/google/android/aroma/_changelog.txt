ArchiDroid 1.7.1

- [!] Added Multi-DPI fixes, thanks to MyLifeRocks10
# In most scenarios you don't need to use App Settings anymore

- Added Yank555.lu Kernel (beta2+)
# It comes already pre-tweaked with my preset
# If you want to use your own settings please reflash the kernel

- Fixed ADMANY permissions
# It caused CoolTool's settings to be sticky
# You need forced update or full wipe to apply new ADMANY

- Fixed root issues, updated SuperSU to 1.65
