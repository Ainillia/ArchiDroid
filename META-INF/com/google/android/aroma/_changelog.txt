ArchiDroid 2.1.6
- All custom keyboards (including hacker's and touchpal) are now installed as SYSTEM apps, not user apps.
# This change was borrowed from ArchiDroid 1.X, thanks to @qgp from my local polish android forum.
# A keyboard is required to decrypt encrypted /data partition, and thus it's impossible to do so without a keyboard available as system app.
# Full wipe is not required but I advise to manualy delete TouchPal and/or Hacker's keyboard from /data/app because it may be doubled now.
# Touchpal is NOT COMPATIBLE with /system/app, thus it has been reverted to /data/app as before. I don't like it.

- Aroma cleaning, round #2, #3 and #4
# Round 2 - Aroma is now fully multi-language compatible, thanks to total rewrite basicly everything.
# If you would like to see your own language in aroma please take a look at HOWTO on xda's topic of ArchiDroid 2.X project.
# As for now we have Albanian (thanks to CEPi), German (thanks to beyerservice) and Turkish (thanks to ZiR0). I've also fixed English and Polish languages by myself.
# Round 3 - Finally I was able to throw away useless /tmp/bash during installation, thus changing all my script to native sh provided by busybox instead.
# This may have positive effect on freezing during executing my scripts at 8% in aroma. Additionally I slightly rewrited my scripts to minimize risk of a freeze.
# Round 4 - I also threw away old update-binary-installer and replaced it with native CyanogenMod's one. This can also have positive effect to overall flashing.

- Added Online Nandroid Backup (onandroid 9.00) utility to /system/bin.
# Onandroid gives you a possibility of doing backup without rebooting to recovery. This isn't an app, it's a very advanced script which I can include with AD.
# I've also written a script for you - ArchiDroid_OnlineNandroidBackup, which makes a backup with just one click. To learn more please type onandroid -h from terminal.
# This tool has been developed by @ameer1234567890. All credit goes to him, I'm only utilizing his tool in my own scripts.
