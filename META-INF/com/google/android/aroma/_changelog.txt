ArchiDroid 2.0.3
FULL WIPE REQUIRED

- [!] Improved ArchiDroid Update mode. FULL WIPE REQUIRED. Now ArchiDroid will overwrite apps with new versions instead of duplicating them (bug)
- [!] Added requested 241 DPI, it's now default DPI for ArchiDroid preset and custom installation. Thanks to @mrtur
# This is due to some minor graphic glitches on all DPIs <= 240. DPI 240 is still available, with a little warning.

- Updated and rewrited Archi's presets for temasek kernel. I got rid of useless files and made it more universal. Also I disabled backlight of hardware keys on screen touch (new temasek's kernel feature). Stock sammy's feature
- Removed Call Recording Xposed module, as it was not working
- Rewrited build.prop tweaks for less battery drain and better stability. Please take look at /system/build.prop after flashing, you can find very interesting tweaks there
- Updated Temasek Kernel to 010813 with GPU STweaks support (my own commits). Feel free to experiment with that
- Updayed Yank Kernel to 1.6e-beta7 and Archi's preset for Yank Kernel.
- Updated Nova to 2.2beta4 (it's a really nice update)
- Updated Spirit FM to 0731 version
- Updated Google Play Store to 4.2.9 (Multi DPI Patched, Inverted)
- Updated Boeffla Sound Control to 1.7.1
- Updated Titanium Backup to 6.1.0
- Updated MXPlayer to 1.7.16
