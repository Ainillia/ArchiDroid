ArchiDroid 2.2.1
- [!] Added "Previous Preset" function to AROMA
# Now you can load your preset chosen during previous flashing, as long as it passes integrity check
# Please note that this function works from now onwards, so it won't load settings from 2.2.0
# Please also note that your preset must pass integrity check. This typically means that if I add any new option then you'll need to create your preset once again.
# This feature is mostly useful for users using experimentals, as they don't need to modify aroma preset every time, while still keeping in-sync with all new features provided by me

- [!] Fixed permissions problem caused by ADMANY (Presets)
# For now it only affects Cool Tool. User was not being able to modify settings of the app after RunOnce applied preset
# It is now fixed with additional workaround if universal method fails.
# That means you can now modify Cool Tool settings after installation.
# Please notice that you need ArchiDroid Install mode to apply new ADMANY (as always, optional).
# Eventually you can create /data/media/0/ArchiDroid/FORCE file after flashing (before first boot) to force RunOnce to apply both ADMANY and DBUPDATE (overrides your settings, if any)

- Merged Paranoid GAPPS and updated inverted (g)apps
# Includes updated Google Apps and inverted Facebook/Youtube
# I've used smallest possible .zip, with deleted (useless for me) gapps. If you for whatever reason want full package then you can download it manualy or download needed apps through google store
# I try to keep it as minimalistic as possible, featuring only core and optional inverts in aroma
# I've also merged Google Ears and Google Now into core package. Google Now is automatically deleted if you tick Google Voice in aroma, as you can use only one of these.

- Added AROMA File Manager (built-in)
# It's available under /data/media/0/clockworkmod/aromafm/aromafm.zip
# Pro tip: You can double-tap in PhilZ Touch Recovery to load aroma file manager whenever you need to do so
