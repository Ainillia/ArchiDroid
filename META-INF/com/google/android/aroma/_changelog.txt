ArchiDroid 2.2.5

- [!] OpenPDroid is now available once again
# It's fully working, with brand new OpenPDroid manager, hooray!

- [!] Updated GAPPS to PA GAPPS 4.4 (ultra-clean mini package)

- [!] RunOnce (ArchiDroid Backend) Update
* Hot Reboot has been replaced by Standard Reboot (required for new parts)
* Reboot (called by backend) now plays a sound to let you know that it's intended
* Code Clean-Up
* CrossBreeder's Tweaks are now active in Install and Forced Update modes
# (yo dawg I heard you like tweaking, so I'm tweaking your tweaker so it could tweak while I tweak it)
# It includes enabled AdBlock (yes, don't use AdAway, it slows your device with such big hosts file) and disabled non-universal tweaks, like readahead (no more forced 4096)
* Added MANY Android 4.4-specific fixes, for example default keyboard handling

- Small changes in Archi's presets for Boeffla kernel
# Ultra PowerSave is now based on Power Saving PegasusQ instead of Yank's Extreme Battery ZZMoove
# Additionally audio preset has been changed from "custom" to "Archis audiphile". Huge thanks to @Lord Boeffla for implementing this!

- Updated PhilZ Touch Recovery to 6.0.0 (works with kitkat)
# Unfortunately you need to flash it manualy because ArchiDroid flashes recovery as the last step
