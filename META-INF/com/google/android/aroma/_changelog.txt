ArchiDroid 2.3.1

- [!] Added built-in Debian "Jessie" 8.0 into ArchiDroid
# Okay, this is big. In general you can jump into debian's chroot and execute 
# any program compatible with armhf/armel architecture. Thanks to chroot you
# don't need to waste precious resources for emulating or virtualization
# to gain everything what debian offers. I tried to make as feature-rich
# environment as possible, including pre-tweaked environment, full apt-get
# support, services support and Android compatibility. As for now I couldn't
# find an app/binary which doesn't work well with my "pocket debian".
# Yes. You can launch (nearly) EVERYTHING in my pocket debian, as long as it's
# compiled for armhf/armel architecture. That's why I selected debian as my
# pocket environment, because it has best armhf/armel support.
#
# I even ran nginx, mysql and php-fpm web server, serving dynamic content
# to the clients over standard 80 port, without any problems. It's impossible 
# to do so in Android environment.
#
# It's mostly targeted at very advanced linux users, who know exactly what to do
# with such great power which ArchiDroid offers right now. Please take care because
# environment still directly connected with Android (unless you launched debian with
# bare mode), so in fact you CAN damage your system if you have no idea what you're doing.
# (Same goes with root and super user by the way, so it's not that scary)
#
# Write "adlinux" and "debian" commands to start the party.
# More will be described in the main thread on xda soon

- Updated Cool Tool to 5.1.1 + Archi's preset for Cool Tool
# It'll now show you the most resource-intensive process if it takes more than
# 80% of available resources. May be useful if you notice 100% CPU consumption
# Additionally deleted cpu graph, hidden annoying notification, fixed iostat
# (showing proper I/O after full wipe) and various other misc improvements

- Removed Googy Max kernel (for good)
# Because it doesn't work with Omni and I'm not sure if googy is interested in Omni support...
- Added Devil kernel
# ... As a perfect replacement for Googy Max with working dual boot. Credits to @DerTeufel1980
