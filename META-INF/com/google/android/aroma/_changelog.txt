ArchiDroid 2.2.1
- [!] Added "Previous Preset" function to AROMA
# Now you can load your preset chosen during previous flashing, as long as it passes integrity check
# Please note that this function works from now onwards, so it won't load settings from 2.2.0

- [!] Fixed permissions problem caused by ADMANY (Presets)
# For now it only affects Cool Tool. User was not being able to modify settings of the app after RunOnce applied preset
# It is now fixed with additional workaround if universal method fails.
# That means you can now modify Cool Tool settings after installation.
# Please notice that you need ArchiDroid Install mode to apply new ADMANY (as always, optional).
# Eventually you can create /data/media/0/ArchiDroid/FORCE file after flashing (before first boot) to force RunOnce to apply both ADMANY and DBUPDATE (overrides your settings, if any)

- Added AROMA File Manager (built-in)
# It's available under /data/media/0/clockworkmod/aromafm/aromafm.zip
# Pro tip: You can double-tap in PhilZ Touch Recovery to load aroma file manager whenever you need to do so

- Small fixes to ArchiDroid Backend
* Everything is more verbose now, Init.log Sqlite.log Zipalign.log and more.

- Updated DBUPDATE
* Ram usage on recent apps page
* Clear button on the right position
* Kill app with long press of back button (3 seconds)
* Default backlight (buttons) delay from 5s to 1s (also present in AD 2.2, forgot to mention)

* AOKP Custom Animations App Override active
