ArchiDroid 2.3.6

- [!] Implemented F2FS
# Don't touch it yet unless you want to brick your device

- ADBLOCK: Added FORCE_LOCAL_DNSES, which may be useful in case of wrong answers from global DNSes but good from local ones, which are slower than global ones. Disabled by default
- Fixed AdBlock not working on some kernels
- Xposed is now pre-activated if chosen in aroma
