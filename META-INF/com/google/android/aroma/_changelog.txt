ArchiDroid 2.0.3
- Improved ArchiDroid Update mode. Full Wipe recommended. Now ArchiDroid will overwrite apps with new versions instead of duplicating them (bug)
- Removed Call Recording Xposed module, as it was not working
- Rewrited build.prop tweaks for less battery drain and better stability. Please take look at /system/build.prop after flashing, you can find very interesting tweaks there.
- Updated Nova to 2.2beta2 (it's a really nice update)
- Updated Spirit FM to 0731 version
- Updated Google Play Store to 4.2.9 (Multi DPI Patched, Inverted)
