ArchiDroid 2.2

- [!] Temporary solution for fixing /data/media/0/0 loop. AD 2.2 postponed until it's fixed in universal way by CM.
# I've implemented a simple workaround which just reverts a problem caused by android, but that's dirty solution provided by my backend, definitely can't stay here for long
# RunOnce will tell you through it's log whenever bug exists and if it's fixed

- [!] ArchiDroid is now built from source, thus it's independent fork of CM now
# ArchiDroid is based on @Cristiano Matos (crDroid) sources, but it's self-compiled by me
# From technical point of view this is a big change, but from your point of view it still has nearly all functions provided by temasek, f.e. HALO, Navigation bar, and more
# Slowly *maybe* AD will have even more unique features, as for now consider it as independent crDroid-fork
