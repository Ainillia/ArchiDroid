ArchiDroid 2.1.6
- All custom keyboards (including hacker's and touchpal) are now installed as SYSTEM apps, not user apps.
# This change was borrowed from ArchiDroid 1.X, thanks to @qgp from my local polish android forum.
# A keyboard is required to decrypt encrypted /data partition, and thus it's impossible to do so without a keyboard available as system app.
# Full wipe is not required but I advise to manualy delete TouchPal and/or Hacker's keyboard from /data/app because it may be doubled now.
