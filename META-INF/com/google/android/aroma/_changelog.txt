ArchiDroid 2.2.2
- Moved ArchiDroid_Detect to the last step in AROMA.
# Should fix most of the back button issues

- Added No Keyboard and No Launcher options to aroma
# These should be used only if you already have working launcher/keyboard, f.e. in update option after you're set.
# Should NOT be used when you're flashing for first time with full wipe, unless you can add your launcher/keyboard as .apk file manualy BEFORE first boot
# System needs at least one launcher and one keyboard during initial booting to function normally.

- Added French language, thanks to @nmeuret
- Updated Boeffla Kernel & App to 2.0-beta3
- Updated Temasek Kernel to 231013
- Updated Yank's Kernel to 1.6g-beta7 (and Archi's config for Yank's Kernel)
- Updated Google Play to 4.4.21 (Multi DPI Patched, Inverted)

- Updated CM source
# This is a really big CM update. I synced all crDroid's packages with CyanogenMod upstream (they were a bit outdated)
# Additionally I resolved a dozen of conflicts, forked independent repos and in general "synced" with CM upstream
# Literally, updated with ALL CyanogenMod commits apart from Settings app and main framework. Also with abandoned ones from crDroid, as I have independent base now.
# There is really too much to mention. Just take a look at my GitHub if you're interested.
# It also includes a few cherry-picks from temasek's sources:
* Removed CMUpdater
