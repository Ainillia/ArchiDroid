# Write adflash command in terminal to get more info

- ArchiDroid Backend Update
* Added custom boot sound support. ArchiDroid will now play /data/media/0/ArchiDroid/PowerOn.wav if available. It's for you if you'd like to have boot sound instead of silence. Other formats are NOT available, only .wav.
* Added Keyboard handling. ArchiDroid will now set your keyboard according to your aroma choice. This is extremely important because Android doesn't do it automatically now (in 4.4)
* Some new DBUPDATE values based on OmniROM.
