ArchiDroid 2.4.4

- [!] ArchiDroid is now built with Linaro Daily (GCC 4.10)
# In comparision with previously used 4.8, some interesting changes:
# C++ hidden keyed methods can now be optimized out.
# Calls that were speculatively made direct are turned back to indirect where direct call is not cheaper.
# New time profiling determines typical order in which functions are executed.
# A new function reordering pass (controlled by -freorder-functions) significantly reduces startup time of large applications
# Feedback driven indirect call removal and devirtualization now handle cross-module calls when link-time optimization is enabled.

- [!] Code revision, big cleanup and optimizations in ArchiDroid scripts and tools
- ADBLOCK: Fixed adblock sometimes not working on mobile data connection
- Archi_UltraPowerSave Boeffla preset now uses noop/noop I/O scheduler (previously: row/cfq)
- Changed ArchiDroid-specific /dev/archidroid implementation to more flexible tmpfs mounted under /system/archidroid/tmpfs, this is to make i9305, i9000, YP-G1 and all future ports happier
# Fellow ArchiDroid-ports users, this should fix ARCHIDROID_CRON for you - Tethering and Adblock

- Updated ArchiDroid Backend (dnsmasq, inotify-tools) to latest versions
- Updated Googy Max kernel to 2.3.1
- Updated PA GAPPS to 26 April
- Updated Cool Tool to 5.4.1
- Updated GravityBox to 3.1.1
- [!] Updated sources
# Due to some stability problems I decided to stick purely with Omni base and not cherry-pick features not-yet approved
# Reverted:
# - Animation Controls
# - Theme Engine
# - Battery Power Saver
# - Messaging FC fix
# - Boeffla settings not sticking after reboot fix
# If you want them merged, visit gerrit.omnirom.org or jira.omnirom.org
# This made ArchiDroid rock stable again, after messy 2.4.3
