ArchiDroid 2.3.4

- [!] Mount/Umount Core changes
# ArchiDroid now uses my own mount/umount commands, which results in mounting partition with automatic filesystem and path instead of hard-coded one
# Also I replaced format command with generic rm -rf /system/*
# This is a preparation for f2fs being developed by @DerTeufel1980
# ArchiDroid should be now fully compatible with flashing on top of f2fs /system, as long as /system is mounted properly
# Also, flashing is faster now
# Initial idea thanks to DerTeufel1980

- [!] Fixed half-broken ArchiDroid Backend with Devil Kernel
# It...will...never...break...again.

- Updated DBUPDATE (RunOnce)
# As always, at least forced update mode will be needed to reapply this
# Animations, volume-skip music, TRDS, and more
