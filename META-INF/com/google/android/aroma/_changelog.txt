ArchiDroid 2.2.5

<tempchangelog>
- SCREW CHANGELOG, WE HAVE KITKAT
- It SEEMS stable enough to put it in experimental, however take care anyway

- WARNING! YOU NEED REQUIRED RECOVERY TO FLASH THIS EXPERIMENTAL
!! Flash required_recovery.zip and then restart your recovery, this is MANDATORY (or you'll get set_perm errors). PhilZ doesn't work yet, sorry

!! WARNING, ARCHIDROID IS NOT YET MERGED SUCCESSFULLY, NO TESTS APART FROM BAREBONES PRESET WERE MADE
!! In other words choose barebones preset or you're on your own. Don't expect anything from first experimentals.

- KNOWN BUGS / ISSUES:
a) External SD Cards don't work, at least exFAT-formatted ones
