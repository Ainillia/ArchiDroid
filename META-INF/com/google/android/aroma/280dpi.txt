Warning! You've chosen incompatible/custom DPI mode!
Please keep in mind that this is custom dpi mode and it won't work with all apps provided by Google Play, they'll show as incompatible ones. But don't worry. If you want to fix it then please MAKE SURE that you'll INCLUDE Xposed Framework (in next aroma step) and also Google PlayStore Fixed module. Then after flashing please open xposed application, install it and activate google store fix module by taping on checkbox on left from it. Lastly - reboot your device to apply changes.
